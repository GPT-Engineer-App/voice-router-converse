Building an App with OpenRouter and Voice-to-Voice Conversation
To create an app that uses OpenRouter model selection and voice-to-voice conversation, you would need to integrate several components:
OpenRouter: This is a platform that provides access to various large language models (LLMs). You can select the desired model for your app through their API 
.
Voice-to-Voice Conversation: This involves converting text responses from the OpenRouter model into speech, and converting user speech into text. There are several APIs available for this, such as Google's Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text APIs.
11 Labs: While I couldn't find specific information about 11 Labs, if it's a platform or service you're interested in, you would need to integrate it into your app as well.
Code Implementation
To implement this, you would need to:
Select a Model from OpenRouter: This involves making a request to the OpenRouter API and specifying the model you want to use.
Convert User Speech to Text: You can use a Speech-to-Text API to convert user speech into text that the OpenRouter model can process.
Process User Input with OpenRouter Model: Send the user's text input to the OpenRouter model and receive a text response.
Convert Model Response to Speech: Use a Text-to-Speech API to convert the model's text response into speech that the user can hear.
